is, it calculates how long a set of joints has remained within a specified
threshold. This package is experimental and unstable. Expect its APIs to change.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
